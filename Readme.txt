 **Meeting with Ben**
Kinetic Chain Timeline & Strength
  -wants tooltip to stay visible after click
  -Fix Bar charts in strength
  -timing measures should use 10 metrics from email

Trends
  - remove multiple selections for the bars graphs
  - wants tooltips floating higher
  - Adjust the tooltips color styles to match psd
  - Ben made aware of bad data in Foot contact metric
    that was causing the charts to look funny
  - wants the label of 'MLB Avg' on the orange line
  - IF POSSIBLE : for the type2 graphs, he wants the
      bar graphs to grow in either direction depending upon
      a positive or negative value. if there is a ZERO
      value, display a small bump to represent the zero value
      so there isn't confusion that it could possibly be
      missing data instead of an actual 0 score result.
  - Trunk is mission 2 metrics in the accordion, and they
    are in HIPS by mistake as the first 2 metrics.

Player Comparison
  - Ben wants the filters back, but Joe swatted it down to
    a version two thing, so it is not promised for launch.
